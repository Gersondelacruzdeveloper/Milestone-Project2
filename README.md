Hello, this is my portfolio and is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at the Code Institue. The main requirements were to make a static but responsive website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

The project is developed primarily using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a small amount of **JavaScript** implemented for additional functionality.

##  User Experience

### Strategy

- The User centred Design process started with the creation of the User Stories.  These influenced subsequent feature, layout, and design decisions.

- The main goal for my portfolio website is to attract new recruiters or potential employers to encourage them to hire me as a developer. 

- The portfolio has been designed to provide minimal, but relevant, content that is easy to access, which satisfies the needs of recruiters or potential employers. 

- Animations have been used extensively throughout the site in order to showcase the results of what I can achieve with my software developing knowledge.

#### User Stories

#### Potential employer
I am an employer looking for software developers: 
- I need to be convinced as to why I should hire this developer. 
- I want to find out about what projects he has done.
- I want to find out what programming languages he knows.
- I want to find out if can contact him.
- I want to find out if he has a printable CV. 
- I want to find out if he is currently available.
- I want to find out what skills does he has.
- I want to find out if he has any experience in software development.
- I want to find out what type of developer he is e.g., frontend, backend, full-stack developer.
- I want to find out if he has a GitHub page.
- I want to find out if he has a LinkedIn page.
- I want to find out if I can contact him directly to his number.


#### Portfolio owner
I am the portfolio owner:
-	I want to encourage more recruiters and potential employers to contact me.
-	I want to clearly display information about what I do, my skills, and programming languages I know.
-	I want recruiters and potential employers to view if I am currently available.
-	I want recruiters and potential employers to view my LinkedIn page.
-	I want recruiters and potential employers to be able to contact me easily.
-	I want recruiters to be able to print my CV.
- I want recruiters and potential employers to view my GitHub page.
-	I want to showcase all the projects I have done, which will give then confident of what realistically I can do.

###  Scope

The key features of the portfolio were developed based on the employers or recruiters needs. 
Employers or recruiters should be able to do the following on the portfolio.
- View my photo, my name and what I do
- Print my CV
- Be able to go to my GitHub profile
- Be able to go to my LinkedIn profile
- Send me a message directly with WhatsApp
- Be able to view my knowledge level in Software development
- Be able to view my work experience
- Be able to view the projects I have done
- Contact me for any enquiries for future employments

### Structure

After identifying what the recruiters and potential employers are looking for in a portfolio the following features were chosen:

- A nice paragraph with my name, image and what I do.
-	Progress bar loading my knowledge level in software development 
-	Bullets points showcasing my experiences
-	Different projects that when hover one show info about the project
-	WhatsApp links
-	GitHub links
-	LinkedIn links 
-	Printable CV
-	Portfolio logo
For ease of navigation, it was decided to opt for a multi-page site, grouped into 5 pages: Home, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact.

### Skeleton

The UI wireframing tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), was used to create wireframes for each site page as it would appear on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

The main content areas were expressed in similar ways to create consistency across the site.

A title and motivational heading were included at the top of each page.
To help recruiters and potential employers, navigate through the site efficiently navbar was decided upon for desktop viewers. The smaller, neater 'hamburger' icon with accompanying dropdown menu was chosen to provide mobile and tablet users with a less cluttered screen and therefore, a more pleasant browsing experience.
A footer, which contains very important information: copy right, link of printable CV, LinkedIn link, GitHub link, and WhatsApp link, all of these were included at the bottom of every page.

## Testing

[Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) were used extensively throughout the development process in order to test whether elements were responsive when viewed on mobile and tablet devices. When problems were encountered the Device Selector was used to target the element.  Using the Elements Panel in Developer Tools the code in question was altered in order to achieve the desired result. 
Working code snippets were then replicated in the style.css file in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Other solutions for errors were found in the Code Institute [Slack](code-institute-room.slack.com) channels, on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) and on [Code Pen](https://codepen.io).

  ### Home Page
The website was regularly tested using the Google Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse test. During the testing I solved many issues however I still have two main issues according to Chrome Developer tool: 

 1 - The main issue is to do with **Accessibility**, Google Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse says, "Attribute do not match their role" and point me to a div at the footer. [Image of the issue](assets/documentation/testing/aria-error.png). After trying to figure out this problem and spending days. Decided to temporary delete all the div on the website and run again the Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse test, afterward I noticed that the developer tool still saying that a div was causing this problem however there were no div. 
 
   **Solution 1** 
  - After discussing the issue with my mentor and tutor **Gurjot Singh** he suggested the issue was because I installed a Software called Grammarly. After removing this software from Google Chrome,  then the Developer Lighthouse Test Scores when to 100%.


 2 - The second issue is to do with **Best Practice** on project page giving me 93% of score. [Image of the issue](assets/documentation/testing/aspect-radio-error.png).  Developer tool says "Display images with incorrect aspect ratio" this issue is jut on desktop and do not show on mobile. after searching for some solution on internet I realize that it was an issue with google itself for reference got to [Google chrome Lighthouse issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/7643).

  **Solution 2** 

  - After discussing the issue with my mentor and tutor **Gurjot Singh** he suggested the issue was because I put a width and height to the image directly and he recommend that as best practice I should adjust the image to the size that I wanted to display and not to put any width and height. I have done that and as expected the original error disappeared. However, the page is still on 93% due to low resolution images. These images have been screenshotting from previous website I have done. And I do not have any other image to put on instead.

### HTML Validation

[W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) was used to validate the HTML documents. It highlighted some three errors across the site which have since been recitified: 
- Favicon link has a incorect rel value and the correct value was added
- "The link role is unnecessary for element a with attribute href". The link role was eliminated
- "Duplicated attribute rel". by mistake I added doble atribute to the link rel then one rel attribute was eliminated.

The site currently has no errors:

<br>


### CSS Validation

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to validate the style.css file. 
It highlighted some errors which have since been resolved:
- a missing curly brace was inserted in the CSS file.
- a forward-slash character, left over from a deleted comment, was causing a parse error in the CSS file and was removed.

The style.css file currently has no errors:
